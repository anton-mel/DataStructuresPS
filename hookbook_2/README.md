# Collaboration
I have used the help of ULSs 7 times and each of advice was very useful!

# Discussion
The hardest part was to make the file pass all cases, espesially with explan and contract in the
way there is no segmentat fault. Also it was hard to implement state machine as have never worked with them before.
I wanted to change it back to "if statements", but after talking with ULA's I decided to keep it as
it make it more structered and secured. Quite useful feature

Apart from this, it was hard to implement all sorting algorithms. There was not enought information
how we should have done this. I had a lot of questions like what should happen if we have to same vessels,
or if one of them is NULL. Similar problem I had with skills.

All other part were similar to what we did in the last part. However, we it definetely takes longer time.
Therefore, It would be good next time, If we could have more time for harder parts. 

Despite all the challanges, I really liked this assignment. It tought me a lot
about reading/writting files, din memory alloc/ structs/ software design. 
Also, I strength my understanding on language C.
