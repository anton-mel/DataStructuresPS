# Collaboration
I have used the help of ULSs 7 times and each of advice was very useful!

# Discussion
The hardest part was to make the file pass all cases, espesially with explan and contract.
Also thatnks to my friend, with whom we disscussed few issues in our code.

Despite all the challanges, I really liked this assignment. It tought me a lot
about reading/writting files. Also, I strength my understanding on language C.
During the OH I tried to fixed my sorting ALGO, and expland/ contract functions. 
As a result the best way to handle such kind of issues is to just a draw a picture
on a paper how of this should be implemented in the code. The process is not complex,
but combing eveything together, it is easy to lose something essential to realocate/ free/ etc,
that leads to segmentational fault.
